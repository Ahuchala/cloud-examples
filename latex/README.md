Sage + LaTeX = SageTeX
======================

This demos how Sage and LaTeX can be combined.

Edit the `.tex` file, compile it via `pdflatex sagetex.tex` in the Terminal.

If you change some Sage commands, you have to re-run `sage sagetex.sagetex.sage`
in order to incorporate the changes in the output.
