\section{\texttt{latexmk}}

\texttt{latexmk} is a versatile utility for building \LaTeX documents.

To make it work well with SageTeX (see page \ref{ch:sagetex}),
the file \texttt{latexmkrc} in the current directory defines
additional dependencies and instructions.

For more information, type a terminal \texttt{man latexmk}.

\section{Use \texttt{make} to build the PDF}

Finally, one has to tell the SMC interface to use the Makefile.
In order to do so, click on `build` and change the
command to \texttt{make 'filename.pdf'}.
Then, SageMathCloud will call the Makefile's definition to build the PDF document.

When enabled correctly, at the bottom of each file (like this one here),
this configuration string will appear:

\begin{verbatim}
%sagemathcloud={"latex_command":"make '04-sagetex.pdf'"}
\end{verbatim}

Do not delete it!
